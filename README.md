# Analysis of Complex Networks

## Homework 1

### Instructions

1. Please make sure you download the Group 9 data
2. Make sure you have the homework_1.ipynb file in the same directory as the folders Facebook-Ego and Twitter-Ego
3. Please run all the cells in homework_1.ipynb in order
4. In case the .ipynb file is corrupted you can find an updated version in the repository https://github.com/othmane-mahfoud/hw_1_complex_networks/tree/main

### Assumptions

1. The Description.txt files mention "The 'ego' node does not appear, but it is assumed that they follow every node id that appears in this file.". Based on your email however, I did not link the ego node to the other nodes in the edge file.
2. As clarified in your email, I did not separate between in and out-degrees for Twitter's directed graph when calculating the maximum and average degree of the network.
